# whatsapp-message-recorder 

whatsapp-message-logger is a NodeJS server designed to log all your messages, photos and videos (including those viewed once).

## How it works.
This project behaves like a normal WhatsApp web client, receiving each message and storing it locally. After downloading the packages and running the application, go to WhatsApp and scan the QR code!

## Usage 
```powershell
npm install
```
followed by 
```powershell
npm start
```

Scan the QR code that appears in the terminal.

**THE LOGGING WILL STOP WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR TERMINAL!

My own suggestion would be to use this application on any windows vds. Unfortunately, **it does not support linux at the moment.**
