# whatsapp-message-logger

You will be able to save ALL images and messages (including once viewed messages) from Whatsapp in every detail.

whatsapp-message-logger is a NodeJS server designed to log all your messages, photos and videos (including those viewed once).

## How it works.

This project behaves like a normal WhatsApp web client, receiving each message and storing it locally. After downloading the packages and running the application, go to WhatsApp and scan the QR code!

## Usage

```powershell
npm install
```

after

```javascript
npm start
```

Scan the QR code that appears in the terminal.

## Important

THE **LOGGING WILL STOP WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR TERMINAL!**

My own suggestion would be to use this application on any windows vds.

Unfortunately, **it does not support linux at the moment.**
